## Hi there 👋

I'm Vinit — a Python and SQL Developer from Mumbai, now diving deep into modern Data Engineering tools and practices

- 🔭 Currently building Data pipeline projects to figure out how companies around the world build scalable data infrastructure to help with business decisions.
- 🌱 Learning Apache Airflow and Google Cloud Platform (GCP); next up: Apache Spark and Dimensional Data Modelling.
- 🛠️ Hands-on with batch ETL, DAG orchestration, cloud storage (GCS), and BigQuery for SQL-based analytics.
- 👯 Open to collaborating on Python or Data Engineering projects — happy to start with documentation or good first issues.
- 📫 Outside of tech, I try to read, love talking to people and enjoy to see trees flow with the wind.

Feel free to connect or check out my projects to see what I'm building!
